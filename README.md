# Algorithms (educational purposes)

This repository contains implementation of various algorithms. Most of the implementations have variants with recursion and iteration (to compare both approaches). Source code was written using JavaScript in most cases, thus can be easily run (Node.js required; version 8.9.4 recommended) with Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux) using command:

```node <js_source_file>```
